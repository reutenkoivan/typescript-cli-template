# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create comprehensive documentation about the package.json structure patterns used throughout the monorepo. The documentation will explain the different types of packages, their script organization, dependency patterns, and export configurations. It will serve as a guide for developers working with the monorepo to understand and maintain consistency across all packages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working in the monorepo, I want to understand the package.json structure patterns, so that I can create new packages that follow established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the documentation THEN I SHALL understand the different package types (root, libs, packages, configs)
2. WHEN I examine script organization THEN I SHALL see clear separation between global scripts and Turborepo-managed scripts
3. WHEN I review dependency patterns THEN I SHALL understand workspace references and version management
4. WHEN I look at export configurations THEN I SHALL understand dual ESM/CJS export patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the monorepo, I want clear documentation of script organization in the root package.json, so that I can understand which scripts are global utilities versus Turborepo orchestrated tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the root package.json scripts THEN I SHALL see scripts organized with a clear separator (# comment)
2. WHEN I look at scripts before the separator THEN I SHALL see global utility scripts that run across the entire monorepo
3. WHEN I look at scripts after the separator THEN I SHALL see Turborepo-orchestrated tasks that leverage the task graph
4. WHEN I review script naming THEN I SHALL understand the conventions for different script types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer creating new packages, I want to understand the standard package.json structure for different package types, so that I can maintain consistency across the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a library package THEN I SHALL follow the established patterns for exports, dependencies, and scripts
2. WHEN I create an application package THEN I SHALL include proper bin configuration and entry points
3. WHEN I create a config package THEN I SHALL follow the minimal structure for shared configurations
4. WHEN I set up any package THEN I SHALL use consistent field ordering and naming conventions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with dependencies, I want to understand workspace dependency patterns, so that I can properly reference internal packages and manage external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I reference internal packages THEN I SHALL use the `workspace:*` pattern
2. WHEN I organize dependencies THEN I SHALL properly separate dependencies from devDependencies
3. WHEN I configure engines THEN I SHALL specify consistent Node.js version requirements
4. WHEN I manage versions THEN I SHALL understand how workspace dependencies are resolved

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer publishing packages, I want to understand export configurations, so that I can provide proper dual ESM/CJS support and expose the correct entry points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure exports THEN I SHALL provide both import and require conditions for dual module support
2. WHEN I set up main/module/types fields THEN I SHALL point to the correct compiled outputs
3. WHEN I expose multiple entry points THEN I SHALL use proper export mapping patterns
4. WHEN I configure package.json exports THEN I SHALL always include the package.json export for tooling compatibility
