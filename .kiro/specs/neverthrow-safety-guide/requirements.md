# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating comprehensive documentation that teaches developers how to write safe, error-handling tools using the neverthrow library. The documentation will serve as a guide for implementing robust error handling patterns in TypeScript applications, particularly CLI tools and utilities within the monorepo structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with CLI tools, I want to understand neverthrow fundamentals, so that I can implement proper error handling in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of neverthrow's Result type and its benefits over traditional try/catch patterns
2. WHEN a developer encounters the Result type explanation THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the difference between Ok and Err variants with concrete examples
3. WHEN a developer reviews error handling patterns THEN the system SHALL show how neverthrow prevents runtime exceptions and improves type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CLI application developer, I want to see practical examples of neverthrow usage, so that I can apply these patterns in real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer looks for implementation examples THEN the system SHALL provide code samples for file system operations using neverthrow
2. WHEN a developer needs to handle async operations THEN the system SHALL demonstrate ResultAsync patterns with proper error propagation
3. WHEN a developer works with multiple operations THEN the system SHALL show how to chain Results using map, mapErr, and andThen methods
4. WHEN a developer needs to combine multiple Results THEN the system SHALL provide examples of using combine and combineWithAllErrors functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating neverthrow into existing code, I want migration strategies and best practices, so that I can safely refactor my error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer plans to migrate existing code THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step migration strategies from try/catch to Result patterns
2. WHEN a developer needs to integrate with existing APIs THEN the system SHALL show how to wrap traditional Promise-based functions with neverthrow
3. WHEN a developer works in a team environment THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for consistent error handling patterns across the codebase
4. WHEN a developer encounters performance concerns THEN the system SHALL address the performance implications and optimization strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer building CLI tools in this monorepo, I want specific examples relevant to the project structure, so that I can implement neverthrow patterns that align with the existing architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer works with the file-system library THEN the system SHALL provide examples of integrating neverthrow with existing file operations
2. WHEN a developer builds CLI commands THEN the system SHALL demonstrate error handling patterns for Commander.js and Ink applications
3. WHEN a developer uses the logger library THEN the system SHALL show how to combine structured logging with Result-based error handling
4. WHEN a developer needs to handle validation THEN the system SHALL provide examples of using neverthrow with Zod for input validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging applications with neverthrow, I want debugging and testing guidance, so that I can effectively troubleshoot and test my error handling logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to debug Result chains THEN the system SHALL provide techniques for tracing error propagation and identifying failure points
2. WHEN a developer writes unit tests THEN the system SHALL demonstrate testing patterns for both success and error cases with neverthrow
3. WHEN a developer encounters complex error scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide strategies for error categorization and recovery patterns
4. WHEN a developer needs to log errors THEN the system SHALL show how to extract meaningful error information from Result types for logging purposes
