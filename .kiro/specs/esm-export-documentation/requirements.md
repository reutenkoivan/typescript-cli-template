# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating comprehensive documentation about ES modules (ESM) and how we organize exports from libraries in our TypeScript monorepo. The documentation will serve as a guide for developers working with the codebase, explaining our ESM-first approach, dual output strategy, and export patterns that ensure compatibility and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working in the monorepo, I want clear documentation about ESM module patterns, so that I can understand how to properly structure imports and exports in library packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the documentation THEN they SHALL understand the difference between ESM and CommonJS modules
2. WHEN a developer creates a new library THEN they SHALL know how to structure exports using our established patterns
3. WHEN a developer imports from internal libraries THEN they SHALL understand the correct import syntax and patterns
4. IF a developer needs to add new exports THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear guidelines on barrel exports and re-exports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want documentation on dual output configuration, so that I can ensure libraries work in both ESM and CommonJS environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a library is built THEN it SHALL produce both ESM and CommonJS outputs as documented
2. WHEN package.json is configured THEN it SHALL follow the documented dual export patterns
3. WHEN tsdown.config.ts is set up THEN it SHALL match the documented build configuration
4. IF a library needs to support both module systems THEN the documentation SHALL explain the configuration requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new team member, I want examples of proper export organization, so that I can follow established conventions when contributing to libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing export examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate barrel exports from index files
2. WHEN examining library structure THEN examples SHALL show proper file organization for exports
3. WHEN looking at import patterns THEN examples SHALL demonstrate workspace dependency usage
4. IF creating named vs default exports THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear guidance on when to use each

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging import issues, I want troubleshooting guidance for common ESM problems, so that I can quickly resolve module-related errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering import errors THEN the documentation SHALL provide common solutions
2. WHEN dealing with mixed module types THEN troubleshooting steps SHALL be clearly outlined
3. WHEN workspace dependencies fail to resolve THEN the documentation SHALL explain resolution strategies
4. IF build outputs are incorrect THEN diagnostic steps SHALL be provided

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer setting up tooling, I want documentation on how ESM affects development tools, so that I can configure my environment correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring TypeScript THEN the documentation SHALL explain module resolution settings
2. WHEN setting up testing THEN ESM compatibility requirements SHALL be documented
3. WHEN using development tools THEN any ESM-specific configuration SHALL be explained
4. IF tools require special ESM handling THEN workarounds or alternatives SHALL be provided
