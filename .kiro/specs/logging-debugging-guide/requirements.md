# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive logging and debugging guide that provides clear guidelines, best practices, and examples for implementing consistent logging and debugging across all libraries and packages in the monorepo. The guide will help developers understand when to add logging, how to structure debug information, and how to maintain consistency across the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on CLI libraries, I want clear guidelines on when and how to add logging, so that I can implement consistent logging patterns across all packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to add logging to a new function THEN the guide SHALL provide clear criteria for determining log levels
2. WHEN a developer implements error handling THEN the guide SHALL specify required logging patterns for errors and exceptions
3. WHEN a developer creates user-facing operations THEN the guide SHALL define when to use info vs debug vs error logging
4. IF a function performs file system operations THEN the guide SHALL specify required logging for success and failure cases
5. WHEN a developer adds async operations THEN the guide SHALL provide logging patterns for async function entry, exit, and error states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining CLI packages, I want standardized debugging utilities and patterns, so that I can efficiently troubleshoot issues across different packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to debug package behavior THEN the guide SHALL provide consistent debug namespace patterns
2. WHEN a developer implements new features THEN the guide SHALL specify how to structure debug output for traceability
3. IF a package has multiple modules THEN the guide SHALL define debug namespace hierarchies
4. WHEN debugging cross-package interactions THEN the guide SHALL provide patterns for tracing execution flow
5. WHEN a developer needs performance debugging THEN the guide SHALL specify timing and performance logging patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using existing logging libraries, I want integration examples and configuration patterns, so that I can properly utilize the existing debug and logger utilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports the debug library THEN the guide SHALL provide correct import and usage examples
2. WHEN a developer uses the logger library THEN the guide SHALL show proper configuration and initialization patterns
3. IF a package needs custom logging configuration THEN the guide SHALL provide extension patterns
4. WHEN a developer needs structured logging THEN the guide SHALL demonstrate proper use of Winston logger features
5. WHEN debugging is needed in production THEN the guide SHALL specify environment variable configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer creating new packages, I want package-specific logging setup instructions, so that I can implement consistent logging from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new library package THEN the guide SHALL provide step-by-step logging setup instructions
2. WHEN creating a new CLI package THEN the guide SHALL specify required logging dependencies and configuration
3. IF a package has multiple entry points THEN the guide SHALL define logging initialization patterns
4. WHEN a package exports utilities THEN the guide SHALL specify logging patterns for exported functions
5. WHEN a package handles user input THEN the guide SHALL define input validation and error logging requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing code, I want logging standards and examples, so that I can ensure consistent logging practices during code reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing logging implementation THEN the guide SHALL provide checklists for proper logging practices
2. WHEN evaluating log messages THEN the guide SHALL define standards for message format and content
3. IF logging performance impact is a concern THEN the guide SHALL provide guidelines for conditional logging
4. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN the guide SHALL specify required logging for different error types
5. WHEN assessing debug output THEN the guide SHALL provide criteria for useful vs excessive debugging information
