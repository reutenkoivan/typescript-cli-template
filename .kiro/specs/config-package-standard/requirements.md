# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a standardized approach for creating configuration packages in the TypeScript CLI template monorepo. Based on the successful patterns established by `@repo/tsdown-config` and `@repo/vitest-config`, this standard will ensure consistency, type safety, and developer experience across all configuration packages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Configuration Factory Pattern

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all configuration packages to follow a consistent API pattern, so that I can easily understand and use any configuration package in the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a configuration package THEN it SHALL export a single `createConfig` function as the primary interface
2. WHEN using any configuration package THEN the API SHALL follow the pattern `createConfig(preset?, configOverrides?)`
3. WHEN no parameters are provided THEN `createConfig()` SHALL return a sensible base configuration
4. WHEN a preset is provided THEN the configuration SHALL merge base config → preset config → user overrides
5. WHEN invalid preset names are used THEN TypeScript SHALL provide compile-time errors

### Requirement 2: Type-Safe Preset System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want preset names to be validated at compile time, so that I can catch configuration errors early and get IDE autocomplete support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining presets THEN preset names SHALL be constrained using `keyof typeof presetConfigs` pattern
2. WHEN using presets THEN IDE SHALL provide autocomplete for available preset names
3. WHEN using invalid preset names THEN TypeScript compiler SHALL show errors
4. WHEN presets are defined THEN they SHALL be documented with clear use cases and configurations

### Requirement 3: Configuration Logging and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed configuration information during development, so that I can debug configuration issues and understand what settings are being applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variable `{TOOL}_VERBOSE=true` is set THEN configuration SHALL be logged to console
2. WHEN logging is enabled THEN output SHALL use consistent formatting with console.table
3. WHEN logging configuration THEN it SHALL show active preset, final merged settings, and custom overrides
4. WHEN logging THEN output SHALL include clear headers and separators for readability
5. WHEN no verbose flag is set THEN no logging SHALL occur

### Requirement 4: Environment-Aware Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurations to automatically adapt to development vs production environments, so that I get optimal settings for each context without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `NODE_ENV=production` is set THEN configuration SHALL apply production optimizations
2. WHEN in development mode THEN configuration SHALL include development aids (source maps, verbose output)
3. WHEN environment detection occurs THEN it SHALL be consistent across all configuration packages
4. WHEN environment-specific settings are applied THEN they SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 5: Package Structure and Exports

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all configuration packages to follow consistent structure and export patterns, so that I can easily navigate and understand any configuration package.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a configuration package THEN it SHALL be placed in `configs/{tool-name}/` directory
2. WHEN defining exports THEN package SHALL export TypeScript source directly for workspace packages
3. WHEN package.json is created THEN it SHALL include both modern exports and legacy types field
4. WHEN dependencies are defined THEN the underlying tool SHALL be included as both dependency and peerDependency
5. WHEN package is named THEN it SHALL follow `@repo/{tool-name}-config` pattern

### Requirement 6: Documentation Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for each configuration package, so that I can understand usage patterns, available presets, and customization options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a configuration package THEN it SHALL include a comprehensive README.md
2. WHEN documenting usage THEN README SHALL include basic usage, preset usage, and custom configuration examples
3. WHEN documenting presets THEN each preset SHALL have clear description of its purpose and settings
4. WHEN documenting API THEN function signatures SHALL be clearly specified with parameter types
5. WHEN providing examples THEN they SHALL be real-world examples from the monorepo

### Requirement 7: Configuration Merging Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want predictable configuration merging behavior, so that I can understand how my custom settings will interact with base configurations and presets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN merging configurations THEN order SHALL be: base config → preset config → user overrides
2. WHEN merging nested objects THEN deep merging SHALL be applied for configuration objects
3. WHEN arrays are provided in overrides THEN they SHALL completely replace preset/base arrays
4. WHEN conflicting settings exist THEN user overrides SHALL take highest precedence
5. WHEN merging occurs THEN the process SHALL be deterministic and predictable

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages when configuration is invalid, so that I can quickly identify and fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN clear error messages SHALL be shown
2. WHEN preset names are invalid THEN TypeScript SHALL provide compile-time errors
3. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN errors SHALL include helpful suggestions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL not crash the build process unnecessarily
5. WHEN debugging configuration THEN verbose logging SHALL help identify issues
